This project demonstrates the classification of medical images into different categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The dataset used is the Medical MNIST Dataset, which contains images from six categories: AbdomenCT, BreastMRI, ChestCT, CXR, Hand, and HeadCT.

Project Features

Data Preprocessing: Normalization and augmentation of medical images.

Image Augmentation: Techniques like rotation, zooming, flipping, and shifting are applied to improve generalization.

CNN Architecture: A simple yet effective CNN model for image classification.

Training: Model training with augmented data.

Validation: Validation accuracy of 99.63% on 10% of the dataset.

Testing: Code to test new images using the trained model.
